with a prefix argument or by typing C-u C-h C-n.

Temporary note:
+++ indicates that all necessary documentation updates are complete.
    (This means all relevant manuals in doc/ AND lisp doc-strings.)
--- means no change in the manuals is needed.
When you add a new item, use the appropriate mark if you are sure it applies,
otherwise leave it unmarked.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 25.1

+++
** Building Emacs now requires C99 or later.

** Building Emacs now requires GNU make, version 3.81 or later.

** By default, Emacs no longer works on IRIX.  We expect that Emacs
users are not affected by this, as SGI stopped supporting IRIX in
December 2013.  If you are affected, please send a bug report.  You
should be able to work around the problem either by porting the Emacs
undumping code to GCC under IRIX, or by configuring --with-wide-int,
or by sticking with Emacs 24.4.

---
** The configure option `--with-pkg-config-prog' has been removed.
Use './configure PKG_CONFIG=/full/name/of/pkg-config' if you need to.

** The configure option '--enable-silent-rules' and the command
'make V=0' now do a better job of suppressing chatter.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 25.1


* Changes in Emacs 25.1

** x-select-enable-clipboard is renamed gui-select-enable-clipboard.
Additionally it now also applies to OSX and GNUstep.

** `insert-register' now leaves point after the inserted text
when called interactively.  A prefix argument toggles this behavior.

** New var `truncate-string-ellipsis' to choose how to indicate truncation.

---
** The default value of `history-length' has increased to 100.

+++
** The new variable `term-file-aliases' replaces some files from lisp/term.
The function `tty-run-terminal-initialization' consults this variable
when deciding what terminal-specific initialization code to run.

---
** New variable `system-configuration-features', listing some of the
main features that Emacs was compiled with.  This is mainly intended
for use in Emacs bug reports.

+++
** A password is now hidden also when typed in batch mode.  Another
hiding character but the default `.' can be used by let-binding the
variable `read-hide-char'.

** The new functions `string-collate-lessp' and `string-collate-equalp'
preserve the collation order as defined by the system's locale(1)
environment.  For the time being this is implemented for modern POSIX
systems and for MS-Windows, for other systems they fall back to their
counterparts `string-lessp' and `string-equal'.

*** The ls-lisp package uses `string-collate-lessp' to sort file names.
If you want the old, locale-independent sorting, customize the new
option `ls-lisp-use-string-collate' to a nil value.

*** The MS-Windows specific variable `w32-collate-ignore-punctuation',
if set to a non-nil value, causes the above 2 functions to ignore
symbol and punctuation characters when collating strings.  This
emulates the behavior of modern Posix platforms when the locale's
codeset is "UTF-8" (as in "en_US.UTF-8").  This is needed because
MS-Windows doesn't support UTF-8 as codeset in its locales.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 25.1

** Emacs now supports "bracketed paste mode" when running on a terminal
that supports it.  This facility allows Emacs to understand pasted
chunks of text as strings to be inserted, instead of interpreting each
character in the pasted text as actual user input.  This results in a
paste experience similar to that under a window system, and significant
performance improvements when pasting large amounts of text.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 25.1

** ElDoc
*** New minor mode global-eldoc-mode
*** eldoc-documentation-function now defaults to nil

** pcase
*** New UPatterns `quote' and `app'.
*** New UPatterns can be defined with `pcase-defmacro'.

** Lisp mode
*** Strings after `:documentation' are highlighted as docstrings.

** Rectangle editing
*** Rectangle Mark mode can have corners past EOL or in the middle of a TAB.
*** C-x C-x in rectangle-mark-mode now cycles through the four corners.
*** `string-rectangle' provides on-the-fly preview of the result.

+++
** Macro `pcase' now supports vector qpattern.

** New font-lock functions font-lock-ensure and font-lock-flush, which
should be used instead of font-lock-fontify-buffer when called from Elisp.

** Macro `minibuffer-with-setup-hook' takes (:append FUN) to mean
appending FUN to `minibuffer-setup-hook'.

** Calendar and diary

+++
*** New commands to insert diary entries with Chinese dates:
`diary-chinese-insert-anniversary-entry' `diary-chinese-insert-entry'
`diary-chinese-insert-monthly-entry', `diary-chinese-insert-yearly-entry'.

+++
*** Calendar can list and mark diary entries with Chinese dates.
See `diary-chinese-list-entries' and `diary-chinese-mark-entries'.

*** The mode line of the calendar buffer will not be modified if
`calendar-mode-line-format' is nil.

** New ERT function `ert-summarize-tests-batch-and-exit'.

---
** ntlm.el has support for NTLM2.

---
** The Rmail commands d, C-d and u now handle repeat counts to delete or
undelete multiple messages.

** Rmail can now render HTML mail messages if your Emacs was built with
libxml2 or if you have the Lynx browser installed.  By default, Rmail
will display the HTML version of a mail message that has both HTML and
plain text parts, if display of HTML email is possible; customize the
`rmail-mime-prefer-html' option to `nil' if you don't want that.

** SES now supports local printer functions; see `ses-define-local-printer'.

** In sh-mode, you can now use `sh-shell' as a file-local variable to
specify the type of shell in use (bash, csh, etc).

** The URL package accepts now the protocols "ssh", "scp" and "rsync".
When `url-handler-mode' is enabled, file operations for these
protocols as well as for "telnet" and "ftp" are passed to Tramp.

** Tramp

*** New connection method "nc", which allows to access dumb busyboxes.

** SQL mode

*** New user variable `sql-default-directory' enables remote
connections using Tramp.

*** New command `sql-send-line-and-next' sends the current line to the
interactive buffer and advances to the next line, skipping whitespace
and comments.

*** Add support for Vertica SQL.

** VC and related modes

*** New option `vc-annotate-background-mode' controls whether
the color range from `vc-annotate-color-map' is applied to the
background or to the foreground.

** Calculator: decimal display mode uses "," groups, so it's more
fitting for use in money calculations; factorial works with
non-integer inputs.

** HideIfDef mode now support full C/C++ expressions, argumented macro expansions
, interactive macro evaluation and automatic scanning of #defined symbols.

*** New custom variable `hide-ifdef-header-regexp' to define C/C++ header file
name patterns. Default case-insensitive .h, .hh, .hpp and .hxx.
*** New custom variable `hide-ifdef-expand-reinclusion-protection' to prevent
reinclusion protected header files from being fully hidden.
*** New custom variable `hide-ifdef-exclude-define-regexp' to define symbol
name patterns (e.x. all "FOR_DOXYGEN_ONLY_*") to be excluded.

** TeX mode

*** New custom variable `tex-print-file-extension' to help users who
use PDF instead of DVI.

** Obsolete packages

---
*** gulp.el

---
*** crisp.el, tpu-edt.el, ws-mode.el
These emulations of old editors are believed to be no longer relevant
 - contact emacs-devel@gnu.org if you disagree.

---
*** vi.el, vip.el (try M-x viper instead)


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 25.1


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 25.1

** window-configurations no longer record the buffers's marks.

** inhibit-modification-hooks now also inhibits lock-file checks, as well as
active region handling.

** deactivate-mark is now buffer-local.

** `cl-the' now asserts that its argument is of the given type.

+++
** Mouse click events on mode line or header line no longer include
any reference to a buffer position.  The 6th member of the mouse
position list returned for such events is now nil.

** Menu items in keymaps do not support the "key shortcut cache" any more.
These slots used to hold key-shortcut data, but have been obsolete since
Emacs-21.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 25.1

** Some "x-*" were obsoleted:
*** x-select-text is renamed gui-select-text.
*** x-selection-value is renamed gui-selection-value.
*** x-get-selection is renamed gui-get-selection.
*** x-get-clipboard and x-clipboard-yank are marked obsolete.
*** x-get-selection-value is renamed to gui-get-primary-selection.
*** x-set-selection is renamed to gui-set-selection

** call-process-shell-command and process-file-shell-command
don't take "&rest args" any more.

** New function `alist-get', which is also a valid place (aka lvalue).

** New function `funcall-interactively', which works like `funcall'
but makes `called-interactively-p' treat the function as (you guessed it)
called interactively.

** New function `function-put' to use instead of `put' for function properties.

+++
** New properties that can be specified with `declare':
*** (interactive-only INSTEAD), says to use INSTEAD for non-interactive use.
*** (pure VAL), if VAL is non-nil, indicates the function is pure.
*** (side-effect-free VAL), if VAL is non-nil, indicates the function does not
have side effects.

+++
** New macro `with-file-modes', for evaluating expressions with default file
permissions set to temporary values (e.g., for creating private files).

** You can access the slots of structures using `cl-struct-slot-value'.

** Functions `rmail-delete-forward' and `rmail-delete-backward' take an
optional repeat-count argument.

** Function `sort' can deal with vectors.

---
** New utilities in subr-x.el:
*** New macros `if-let' and `when-let' allow defining bindings and to
    execute code depending whether all values are true.
*** New macros `thread-first' and `thread-last' allow threading a form
    as the first or last argument of subsequent forms.


* Changes in Frames and Windows Code in Emacs 25.1

+++
** Emacs can now draw horizontal scroll bars on some platforms that
provide toolkit scroll bars, namely Gtk+, Lucid, Motif and Windows.
Horizontal scroll bars are turned off by default.
*** New function `horizontal-scroll-bars-available-p' telling whether
    horizontal scroll bars are available on the underlying system.
*** New mode `horizontal-scroll-bar-mode' to toggle horizontal scroll
    bars on all existing and future frames.
*** New function `toggle-horizontal-scroll-bar' to toggle horizontal
    scroll bars on the selected frame.
*** New frame parameters `horizontal-scroll-bars' and
    `scroll-bar-height' to set horizontal scroll bars and their height
    for individual frames and in `default-frame-alist'.
*** New functions `frame-scroll-bar-height' and
    `window-scroll-bar-height' return the height of horizontal scroll
    bars on a specific frame or window.
*** `set-window-scroll-bars' now accepts five parameters where the last
    two specify height and type of the window's horizontal scroll bar.
*** `window-scroll-bars' now returns type and sizes of horizontal scroll
    bars too.
*** New buffer-local variables `horizontal-scroll-bar' and
    `scroll-bar-height'.

** The height of a frame's menu and tool bar are no more counted in the
frame's text height.  This means that the text height stands only for
the height of the frame's root window plus that of the echo area (if
present).  This was already the behavior for frames with external tool
and menu bars (like in the Gtk builds) but has now been extended to all
builds.

** Frames now do not necessarily preserve the number of columns or lines
they display when setting default font, menu bar, fringe width, or
scroll bars.  In particular, maximized and fullscreen frames are
conceptually never resized if such settings change.  For fullheight and
fullwidth frames, the behavior may depend on the toolkit used.
*** New option `frame-inhibit-implied-resize' if non-nil, means that
   setting default font, menu bar, fringe width, or scroll bars of a
   specific frame does not resize that frame in order to preserve the
   number of columns or lines it displays.


* Changes in Emacs 25.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

---
** Building Emacs for MS-Windows requires at least Windows XP
or Windows Server 2003.  The built binaries still run on all versions
of Windows starting with Windows 9X.
