;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The "core" part of EIEIO is the implementation for the object
;; system (such as eieio-defclass, or eieio-defmethod) but not the
;; base classes for the object system, which are defined in EIEIO.
;;
;; See the commentary for eieio.el for more about EIEIO itself.

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'pcase)
